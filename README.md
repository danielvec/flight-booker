## Project Requirements

The goal of this project is to build a site which allows users to book a one-way flight.

**Features**

- Allows users to search for flights from dropdown menus from forms prepopulated with collections of data.

- Uses nested forms to allow for multiple passengers on a single booking.

- Allows users to make a payment with the Stripe API

## Rspec Tests

To run the tests, enter:  
`rspec`
